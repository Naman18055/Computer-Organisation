# BOOTH'S ALGORITHM : 
This Folder contains the code for Booths Algorithm Implementation for Multiplicaiton and Division (Non Resotring).

# FILES : 
1) BoothsAlgo.py contains the Code. To run this file run "python3 BoothsAlgo.py" on the terminal. The code also does testing on some numbers which takes around 1-10 seconds to run and writes the output to a file output.txt. If the code passes all the test cases, then Passed is print on the command line.
2) Output.txt contains the output of multiplication and division of some numbers using Booths Algorithm.
